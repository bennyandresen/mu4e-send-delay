#+STARTUP:	content

* Purpose

Allowing to schedule mails to be sent at a later time. Thus enabling
the ability to "undo send" mails.

I'm aware of [[https://github.com/benmaughan/mu4e-delay][benmaughen's mu4e-delay]] but it was lacking features which
I wanted.
Thanks to him for the inspiration and to Kai Gro√üjohann for
=gnus-delay.el= which I copied code from. (=mu4e-send-delay-add-delay-header=)

Features:

  - mu4e context support
  - Saves scheduled mails to =mu4e-drafts-folder=
  - Uses an emacs timer to check Drafts if a mail is scheduled to be sent now
  - Allows easy edit of the X-Delay header in mu4e-compose-mode
  - Displays scheduled time in *mu4e-view*
  - Doesn't send if mail is currently being edited
  - Works with attachments

* Install

1. Put =mu4e-send-delay.el= into a directory in you load-path and require it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/directory") ; that contains mu4e-send-delay.el
(require 'mu4e-send-delay)
#+end_src

2. Setup mu4e-send-delay-setup
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mu4e-send-delay-setup) ; sets up headers to show up by default
#+END_SRC

3. Initialize the timer that works through the Drafts to send delayed mails
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'mu4e-main-mode-hook 'mu4e-send-delay-initialize-send-queue-timer)
#+END_SRC

** Requirements
- Has only been tested on Emacs 24.5 and later
- With [[https://github.com/djcb/mu-releases][mu 0.9.16]]

* Particularies

Right now the sent buffer will be re-encoded to utf-8, to avoid mml.el complaining upon a scheduled sent.
If you notice your mails arriving garbled despite looking okay in the Drafts, please consider the following emacs options:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
#+end_src

* Recommended settings

Assigning the scheduled enabled send to =C-c C-c=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'mu4e-main-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                 (define-key mu4e-compose-mode-map
                                   (kbd "C-c C-c")
                                   'mu4e-send-delay-send-and-exit)))
#+END_SRC

Now you can =C-c C-c= every mail

** Defaults

- =mu4e-send-delay-default-delay= is set to "3m"
- =mu4e-send-delay-timer= is set to every 2 minutes
- =mu4e-send-delay-include-header-in-draft= is true
- =mu4e-send-strip-header-before-send= is true
- =mu4e-internet-host-test= is "www.gnu.org"

Change these with

=(setq mu4e-send-delay-default-delay "5m")=
